**GiraffeHero is a third-party lib built with iOS and Android’s design and understanding of complex pages. In theory, any complex page can be built by GiraffeHero. However, unlike other libs in implementing multi-type RecycleView, GiraffeHero has different design and understanding of complex pages.**

In our conception, all pages are made up of at least one `Section`. Each `Section` has a separate `Header` and `Footer`, and at least one element inside (we call it `Row`):

Theoretically, code logic of different Section could be completely decoupled, which can be developed and maintained by different people, and it can also be reused among different pages.

Compared to the native `notifyDataSetChanged`, `notifyItemRangeChanged` and `notifyItemChanged`, this lib can help you to refresh a Section, a Row in a Section or just refresh the Header and Footer of a Section. It is especially suitable for page content that is returned by different APIs. Different APIs only need to refresh their corresponding Section when data returned. If one API return errors or just not returned, the corresponding Section will not be displayed.

Welcome to use GiraffeHero, making every page meets the aesthetics of code obsession. :D
